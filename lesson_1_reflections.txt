How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

go line by line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

compare with working and non working version to find out the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

logical breaking is missed with google docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
probably google docs dont care of other docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
using git log you can see the recent commits. and using the two diff ids you can check the changes that are added or deleted.
